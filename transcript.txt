 Thank you for the introduction. I'd like to thank Nicholas Racculia and the St. Vincent College Health and Fitness Club for making me feel so welcome here on your beautiful campus tonight, and for honoring me with the invitation to come and speak. I would also like to thank Andrew for making some of the arrangements for my stay I want to thank my friend and Dept Chair, Dr. Brian O'Neil a physician's physician. who took my shift on Wednesday. so that I could put some of the ﬁnishing touches on this presentation; lwant to thank my beautiful wife Marilyn, my lifting partner, life partner, and my love, for indulging me in this extracurricular career of mine...a|ong with many other indulgences; and I want to thank my dear friend, and benefactor, and teacher, Mark Rippetoe, the author of Starting Strength, without whose inﬂuence and guidance and kindness I would not have embarked on the path that me here to speak to you tonight. And, finally, I want to thank my friend, the very strong Jordan Feigenbaum, who set off this |ec\ure series earlier this year with an extraordinary presetnation, an act | cannot hope to follow, and who chose to do so while wearing a suit and tie, thereby compelling all future speakers to do the same, thanks a Iol, Jordan. Tonight, I would like you to join me in the exploration of a concept that has been gnawing at me for sometime, the concept of the modern aging phenotypes, and in particular the Sick Aging Phenotype, which I conceive as a syndrome of interrelated processes and debilities, particularly sarcopenia, frailty, the metabolic syndrome, and polypharmacy, terms which I will explain as we proceed. we will then examine the power of exercise medicine to combat this sick form of aging, and in particular the power of resistance training for strength. I'll put fon/vard what I believe to be an excellent exercise Rx for those in our 5th decade and beyond, and in the process, we'll have an opportunity to touch brieﬂy on what I believe to be an important and transformative picture of the aging adult. This is a full agenda, and our iime is limited, so I hope you will indulge me, and I will pleased to answer your questions at the conclusion of the presentation. So, let's begin. Our general human attributes take many forms. While we all share common hereditary and species»speciﬁc characteristics, that mark us as members ofa particular strain of hominid, we nevertheless display a vast range of physical, metabolic, and behavioral variations, than is, phenotypes. Phenotype is a strange but useful word, a construction from the Greek: phamen + typos. It is literally the “show type" of an organism: its observable, measurable characteristics, the culmination of influences from its genetics, its development, its environment, its society, and its behavior. The phenotype is to be distinguished from the genotype. The genotype is the molecular blueprint of the organism. The phenotype is the actual construction that we end up with. And like any building, it will have additions and omissions, and imperfections, and marks of use, and weathering and wear and tear, which are included in no blueprint. Two organisms may have very similar or even identical genotypes. and very different phenotypes. Consider a pair of twins I met in my emergency department some years ago, an encounter which affected me deeply. One of these sisters was my patient; the other, her caregiver. My patient was morbidly obese, diabetic, hyperlensive, and suffering from end-stage congestive heart failure. Her sister»-her identical twin sister~~was anything but identical as many African-Americans do, but her condition was well-controlled. and she was lean, active, athletic. and, in her late 50's, a very gorgeous example of healthy aging. She looked 20 years younger than her sister. These ladies had the same molecular blueprint. They grew up in the same house they watched the same TV shows, They were as alike as two human beings can be. And yet, their aging phenotypes, and ultimately their death phenotypes, We are left with little to explain their phenotypic differences without invoking. at least In part. their respective behaviors. My patient freely admitted that, unlike her sister. she had never taken care of herself, that she was sedentary, and a smoker, had never been particularly compliant with her antihypertensive medication. and that even now, she rarely kept her doctor's appointments, and, having no exercise tolerance, rarely left the chair which had become her living space and her bed: The contracted horizon of a lonely and miserable existence. that brought these two ladies with identical genotypes to tragically different phenotpyes. And so, while it is oenainly possible for a Sick Aging Phenotype 10 be the result of bad luck. bad genetics. bad environment, unexpected illness or injury. there are modifiable behavioral factors that do contribute to the development of what I call the Sick Aging Phenotype. Some of which behaviors are indicated here. And I maintain that this Sick Aging Phenotype is a modern aging phenotype. The modern aging phenotypes comprise a spectrum. At one end, we have a Healthy Aging Phenotype, exemplified by my patienfs sister. been available, at least not to so many. It is made possible by advances in nutrition, in medicine, in preventative medicine, particularly HEALTH care, by personal and social hygiene, and by the extraordinary prosperity, stability and social justice of modern Western and industrialized societies. On the average, we actually don't achieve Iifespans that are that much longer than our ancestors than our ancestors did in. say, medieval Britain or medival Europe. especially, if you made it past the vulnerabi|i\y of infancy, and the exuberant, dangerous stupidity of adolescence. we have more opportunity than ever Unlortunately, the Sick Aging Phenotype Is, In my experience, rather more common than the Healthy Aging Phenotype. certainly more common than it should be, and consuming a disproportionate share of health care and social resources. the Sick Aging Phenotype is a modern aging phenotype. made possible by abundance, modern medicine»-particularly SICK care, and by all the other advantages of Western Civilization that make it possible for us to live into our 50s or 60s or 70s without having to worry about smallpox, or plague, or dysemery, or famine.... or the general war that we have somehow failed to ignite for the last 3/4 of a century, although you can't blame some people for trying. Never before has it been possible for so many to reach middle age with so few infectious diseases, so many comforts, so many protections against ancient horrors, both man-made and natural, and with so many donuts and so many hamburgers at so low cost So the Healthy Aging Phenotype and the Sick Aging Phenotype are modern aging phenotypes at the ends of a spectrum that encompasses many avatars of aging, and which, in industrialized countries, is skewing more toward sick than healthy. It's important that I disclose to you that this concept of a Sick Aging Phenotype, this model, is a product of my own fevered imagination, It is rather new, and it will doubtless be subjected to criticism, constructive and otherwise. and even if does prove to be useful and can be sustained, it will have to undergo reﬁnement and revision over lime as we learn more. and as I learn more. But as it stands, my model of the Sick Aging Phenotype is a constellation of features that I encounter daily in my practice as an emergency physician. The Sick Aging Phenotype Is characterized by sarcopenia: that IS, the loss of muscle mass. with attendant declines in bone density and bone mass, and physical capacity, and in ﬂailty , Plus, the metabolic syndrome, which is not one of my concepts. but rather a very well-recognized constellation of clinical features, driven by insulin resistance. And, the Sick Aging Phenotype also includes polypharmacy and medical dependence. Now, there'a a lot going on here, even though this model of the Sick Aging Phenotype is of necessity a distillation, a simp|iﬁcation...a model. Just as an example: frailty is a term that is much-used in the geriatric literature, but here I'm using it in a rather more expansive and idiosyncratic way. in my formulation of the Sick Aging Phenotype, "frailty" Is a lerm that covers a multitude of sins. i1 refers not only in its usual sense of physical susceptibility to illness and injury, It's notjust the inability to ﬁght off the complications of influenza or a broken hip. It's the inability to fight off the complications of life. Itself. It's the loss of the ability to engage in the activities of daily living, to engage in the pursuits that bring us joy and self-actualization, it's the loss of autonomy, of sexual function, of cognitive function, of self respect... Frailty, as I use the term in my formulation of the Sick Aging Phenotype, encompasses horrors and miseries too depressing and manifold to enumerate here. one word to indicate a descent into entire realms of suffering. Bearing all this in mind, that this is a model we're talking about let's take a closer look at the development of this Sick Aging Phenotype. There are many places we could begin, but I wish to focus for the moment on the metabolic syndrome, Notwithslanding factors beyond our immediate control--genetic and environmnental factors" it seems clear that lifestyle variables are sufficient to drive development of the metabolic syndrome. Excessive positive energy balance»-too many Big Macs, not enough exercise-- leads to deconditioning, 1he loss of muscle tissue, and the accumulation of fat--particularly visceral fat, that is, fat around the internal organs. The loss of muscle and the accumulation of visceral fat are profoundly dangerous to our health. Muscle, we have learned, is actually an endocrine organ. That is, it's a kind 0! gland and its disuse an alrophy lead to an abnormal proﬁle of myokines: which are hormones of muscle tissue origin. and its accumulation on the trunk and around the internal organs in the setting of decreased physical activity results in an abnormal and unhealthy adipokine proﬁle... adipokines being hormones of fat origin. Eventually, visceral obesity, excessive caloric intake and decreased physical aclivity produce a state of insulin insensitivity, or insulin resistance. In this state, insulin is still produced, but the responsiveness of tissues to insulin is limited. Obviously, the control of serum glucose, or blood sugar, will be affected. Blood sugar will climb, but the transport of sugar into cells is inhibited. And a state of insulin resistance resembles, in some respects, a fasting state, a starvation state. Insulin resistance has been linked to suppressed release of nitric oxide. an important signaling molecule for the regulation of blood vessel tone. which (loss of nitric oxide) will ullimalely promote the developmenl of hypertension: high blood pressure. Insulin, beyond being a glucose-regulaling hormone, is also a growlh hormone, and the loss of insulin signaling is also a loss of growth factor signaling with very unfortunate etfects for aging tissues throughout the body, And finally, the accumulation of visceral fat, and the loss of insulin sensitivity results in a pro»inﬂammatory state with increased release of c-reactive protein, inflammatory cytokines, tumor necrosis factor, and other inﬂammatory molecules that cause degeneration and damage, with attendant pain and loss of function. This insulin resistance is modeled here for you in a couple of cartoons that really oversimplity the issue. but will give you some idea of what's going on. In the normal state, feeding and increased blood glucose result in the release of insulin, which acts at its cellular receptor: these Y-shaped guys over here, to promote the Iranslocation of glucose Iransporters to the cell membrane. It is these glucose transporters that are the gateways for glucose to enter the cell. but in a state of insulin resistance, insulin receptors are, as they say, "downregulaled," an imprecise term that will do for our purposes, The receptors are fewer in number, or less responsive, or both. So although the blood is full of glucose--and insulin-«here isn't a robust response by insulin signaling systems. and glucose transporters are not moved to the cell membrane in sufficient numbers to deal with the elevated blood glucose. And the decreased number and responsiveness of these receptors has other widespread effects as well: on growth, repair, cellular survival, and gene expression. As the syndrome matures, we see the onset of hypertension, or high blood pressure which contributes Io atherosclerosis, heart disease, and stroke, among other miseries. The systemic inflammation I spoke of earlier wreaks havoc on many tissues, including muscles, joints, blood vessels, and even neurological tissues. And the blood lipid proﬁle becomes deranged, with increases in bad cholesterol and serum triglycerides, which are thought to contribute to the development of vascular disease and heart disease. That's an overview of me metabolic syndrome... and it's bad enough. But it's not the whole story of the Sick Aging Phenotype. This graphic representation WI” help us ﬂesh out the picture. The initial state is here, with modﬁable factors shown in blue. Now, in truth, all of these factors have some impact on each other I've just indicated here, for example, the interplay between culture, environment and diet. Too many Big Macs, not enough exercise, and increased positive energy ﬂux leads to the accumulation of fat, and particularly visceral fat. And decreased physical actlvny. along with aging Itself, leads to muscle atrophy, the loss of muscle tissue. which also leads to decreased physical activity. when you encounter a loop like that in a palhophysiological process, you have trouble. The process becomes se|f»reinforcing, and harder to arrest. all conspire to create this state of insulin resistance, which worsens muscle atrophy. and the accumulation of visceral fat-»more loops The syndrome is getting stronger. Insulin resistance, as we've seen, leads to high blood sugar (hyperglycemia), high blood pressure, systemic inﬂammation, and dyslipidemia. These factors in gray are the components of the metabolic syndrome. And sarcopenia. And so what we have here is the ﬁrst tier, if you will, of the Sick Aging Phenotype. Sarcopenia increases insulin resistance, insulin resistance increases sarcopenia, Ihe syndrome progresses, over time, to the second tier more of an end stage of the Sick Aging Phenotype, characterized by diabetes, heart disease, stroke, frailty, pain and degeneration, and atherosclerosis. We talked about loops in pamophysiological processes positive feedbacks Here. it's getting positively grim. These processes continually feed into each other and reinforce each other making the syndrome more and more refractory. And pretty soon you're in a hole that it's very, very difﬁcult to get out of. And we haven't even talked about polypharmacy and medical dependence yet. As the syndrome progresses, the patient become increasingly dependent on medical intervention for phsylologlcal stability and symptom relief... if not for health. And this promotes the development of polypharmacy, which is simply a fancy word that means "many drugs." It's not uncommon for a patient to come into the Emergency Deparment literally with a shopping bag full of prescription pill bottles, and in a contexl which makes it absolutely clear she has no idea what she's doing with them. One pill bottle was ﬁlled a week ago: It's almost empty. One was ﬁlled six months ago: it's almost full. Multiple doctors on these prescriptions. And so we have a patient who's on 2 or 3 antihypenensives to lower her blood pressure; a diuretic, for the ﬂuid retention; aspirin and clopidogrel to stomp her platelets into submission, so she bleeds easily and bruises easily, sleep aids; antidepressants, narcotic pain medications, and of course prednisone for the chronic inﬂammation. The patient will present saying that she's dizzy and tired. Well, of course she’ dizzy and tired: we doctors have been poisoning her for years. And she needs these poisons, jusl to limp from one day to Ihe next. Her medicines cause side effects, and we prescribe more medicines for the side effects. The Sick Aging Phenotype will ultimately progress to one of a number of sick death phenotypes. Now of course Death comes for us all, as "even for kings he comes" as a Man ForA|I Seasons‘ Thomas More would tell us. But Death tends to come in more unpleasant guises, and to stay longer. and to take more lime at his work for those who suffer from the Sick Aging Phenotype. Indeed, one of the main benefits of a healthy aging phenotype is not a longer natural lifespan, which is beyond the power of any medicine that I'm aware of, but a contraction of morbidity: a shrinking of the dying park of our lives into a Ihinner and thinner slice of time... Of course, any misfortune may befall anybody, and a strong healthy person who has taken care of him or herself may be struck down by illness or injury, just as a wise, rich investor can be ruined by a market crash. But in general, compression of morbidity is a beneﬁt that cannot be expected by those with a Sick Aging Phenotype. The end of that type of aging is, in general, more miserable. more hO|'|'|ﬁC. and more drawn-out For my money, the most obscene and terrifying prospect is that of the "nursing home pretzelz" demented, diapered, immobile, a Purgatory of indescribable suffering. Contracted limbs, bedsores, feeding tubes, chronic dehydration intractable pain, often without even the ability to cry out for relief. Recurrent bouts of pneumonia, and sepsis, until ﬁnally there's nothing left but the last ICU stay, the last festival of needles and catheters and ventilators... and hospital bills. The Sick Aging Phenotype does not always end so horriﬁcally, but the Sick Aging Phenotype is, by any estimation, a catastrophe. I love these old pictures of train wrecks for some reason, but of course we're talking about a modern aging phenotype, so perhaps this image is more appropriate. I'm pretty sure all these fellows In red are Mounties. In my professional life, I am confronted, daily, by a sense of powerlessness before this Sick Aging Phenotype, this Sick Aging train wreck. I have no drugs, no injections, no surgical procedures, that can treat it at the root causes. only pills and potions to normalize this or that laboratory value. or to ease the discomfort, or to put off the release of death a little longer. Now of course there is a medicine that gets to the root of the Sick Aging Phenotype and that is, for want of a better word--and I do want a better word-»"|ifestyle medicine." It's only in the modern era that we've forgotten that the way we live is a sort of medicine. A good medicine or a black medicine, depending on the way we live: On what we eat, on how we work, how we play, on which Inloxlcanls we use. and how often. and how we treat our fellows, and how we live in society. Obviously, today's lecture focuses on one particular facet of lifestyle medicine, exercise medicine. When integrated into a healthy life, this is the most powerlul medicine in the world for the Sick Aging Phenotype and its components. Exercise has powerful effects against sarcopenia, frailty, and the metabolic syndrome. And so exercise gets to the root of the Sick Aging Phenotype. Exercise»any form of vigorous exercise" depending on i\s formulation, intensity and regularity, is likely to have manifold beneficial effecisz On musculoskeletal health, restoring muscle mass, restoring bone mass, restoring tendon and ligament stiffness, the promotion of favorable myokine and adipokine proﬁles. On cardiovascular health: we see improved cardiac function, retarding the development of vascular disease, ﬁghting hypertension. On metabolic health: exercise increases insulin sensitivity and decreases visceral fat--it gets to the root of the metabolic syndrome. On cellular health: increasing the resistance of cells to reactive oxygen stress, free radicals, promoting the development of more mitochondria, the powerhouses ot the cell . and decreasing cell suicide, autophagy and apoptosis. And even on neurological health: on maintaining brain plasticity, and decresing the loss of brain tissue in aging. And so I think exercise is, in a limited sense, a fountain of youth... or at least a fountain of health. But just so we're all keeping our feet ﬁrmly on the ground. let's be clear that there are limits to what even the most powerful medicine in the world can do. Aging and disease bring about siructural, cellular and molecular changes that are extremely difficult or thermodynamically impossible to reverse. So exercise won't really make us younger, of course. It won't cure diabetes, or cancer, it won't shrink your prostate or your bald spot, not be made to be happy. exercise can make us better, and stronger, and healthier. And yes. even more beautiful, if not by the standards of Hollywood truly the most powerful medicine in our armamentarium. What is the correct exercise prescription for Ihe aging adult? then a rational exercise prescription will have the same requirements as any other prescription. It's not hard to come up with a list of such requirements. Our exercise medicine must be safe. I Irust I'll get no argument there. The exercise prescription must allow for a broad range of dosing: We must be able to start at a low dose, and as we get healthier dose... the exact opposite of other medicines. The exercise prescription must be comprehensive: It must address a broad range of general performance attributes, body composition and energy systems. The exercise prescription must speciﬁcally and substantively address the Sick Aging Phenotype And ﬁnally, the exercise prescription must be as simple as possibIe...but no simpler. It is my position that the foregoing considerations will lead us to this: The general exercise prescription for the aging adult will take the form of a training program for the Masters athlete. Now, there are two Big Ideas at work here. The ﬁrst idea is that if exercise is a medicine, the most powerful medicine, then it should be as explicitly and speciﬁcally prescribed as any other medicine No physician would tell his patient, "just get some medicine." Or wriie a prescription that said, "Antibiotics." But some of these same physicians are perfectly comfortable telling their patients, "just get some exercise." A proper exercise prescription must specify the formulation, the dose, the schedule, and the route of administration. And in the case of exercise medicine, man means we must specify the type of exercise. and we must rationally manipulate training variables: volume, intensity, set design, duration, rest intervals, recovery duration, and so on. This very special form of exercise, rationally and speciﬁcally prescribed to drive targeted improvements in physical attributes over time, And individuals who engage in training to optimize their physical performance and body composition They engage in carefully crafted, long term programs of general physical developmenl. but more fundamental, more powerul, and more transformative. It is simply that the aging adults must cease to think of him/herself as an old man or old woman, or even as a patient, an identity that some people positively cling to. Instead, she must think of herself as an athlete of aging, as a Masters athlete, engaged in the most brutal span of all: She may in fact be sick, and frail, and fat and weak. But, armed with the mentality of the athlete. she thinks of these not so much as debilities--which they are-» but as opponents who challenge her, against the clock, in the arena of life and time. As long as she prepares to grapple with these foes by training for that Arena Now this might seem like semantics, just words... but our world, and especially our innerworld. is dominated by words, by signs and symbols and ideas, and I have found that this change in headspace is liberating, empowering, and transformative. So...the strongest and most effective prescription for the aging adull is a training program for the Masters athlete. And that program will be focused on strength training with barbells. This position ﬂows from the criteria I laid out in the previous slide for the formulation of an exercise prescription. I do not have the time this evening to substantively lay out this argument for barbells, although the argument is there, others have made it, and I will present it in other venues and other media. But if I can impose upon you to reserve judgement on that point for the moment, I will use the remainder of my time to focus on the effect of resistance training of any type, barbell or no barbell, and in particular on the metabolic syndrome. You will recall that the metabolic syndrome is composed of these components Truncal obesity, visceral fat, insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, hypertension and systemic inﬂammation.

Resistance training has positive effects on multiple components of the metabolic syndrome, ﬁghting the accumulation of visceral fat, increasing insulin sensitivity, and improving glycemic control, decreasing hypertension and systemic inﬂammation, with its effects on dyslipidemia being rather more murky for the moment. Strength training ﬁghts the metabolic syndrome. And it does this in spite of the almost universal use of low-dose resistance training in this literature. the lack of structural exercises like squats and deadlifts, and standing presses, that systematically and disproportionately shorl-change strength training. Unlike endurance training, which is dependent primarily on enzymatic adaplions, and the ﬁne tuning of energy systems, which the body can accomplish quite quickly. strength training requires not only changes in energy utilization. but also the construction of new tissue: muscle, bone, tendon. which takes a long time, especially in older adults, and which beneﬁt cannot be fully realized in the 842 week interventions used in most studies. But even in the face of these handicaps, resistance training shows itself to be a powerful medicine. Strength training ﬁghts the metabolic syndrome. I maintain that even if we were to adopt an unreasonably skeptical view of the accumulating data on strength training and the metabolic syndrome, strength would still demand a role, a central role in the exercise prescription for the Masters athlete. You will recall after all that the Sick Aging Phenotype is more than just the metabolic syndrome. It is also muscle atrophy, sarcopenia and the associated loss of bone mass, and an expansive concept of frailty, with all the misery that entails. Sarcopenia, the loss of muscle tissue, is endemic in older populations. affecting a quarter to over half of such people, and that under a most conservative deﬁnition of sarcopenia that may not be appropriate. Modern ideas about what constitutes "healthy" muscle mass in older adults may well be overdue for revision. It's as if we were saying that a healthy 401k for a 60-yo should have at least $100k in it. This loss of muscle in aging appears to be due in part to a disproportionate loss of Type II ﬁbers. As some of you may be aware, muscle ﬁbers, which are muscle cells, come in three flavors. The s|ow~lwi!ch ﬁbers, the aerobic fibers, which have very high endurance, Iow fatiguabillty, but which are weak and small. And then there are two types of fasbtwitch ﬁbers, which for our purposes are more alike than they are different, and which are larger, more easily fatigued, less capable of doing aerobic metabolism, and much more strong and powerful. When we look at the literature. we ﬁnd strong Indications that the loss of muscle tissue in aging is dominated by the loss of these high-powered Type II ﬁbers. Consider, for example, this study by Nilwik et al. Nilwik and his co-authors took 25 bros and 26 geezers and had them undergo DEXA scans and CT scans and muscle biopsies pre» and post-6 months (a long period) of resistance training. Perhaps I should say that "geezers" is a term of endearment, and it is self applied. In fact, in our community we have an entire taxonomy of geezers Older lifters may be geezlings, geezoids, geezettes, geezers. geezosaurs or geezoliths, depending on their age. But perhaps we should return to the matter at hand: Nilwik found when he did this study that the muscle cross-sectional area was lower in geezers--no surprise there. The Type I ﬁber size was smaller in geezers, but the Type I fiber number was largely unchanged. Training increased Type I ﬁber size, but not number. The differences in muscle size between the geezers and the bros, and between pre and post-training, was almost entirely due to a Type II fiber size difference. They concluded that the loss of muscle tissue, the loss of muscle size, cross-sectional area, in aging, is primarily due to the atrophy, but not the loss, of Type II muscle ﬁbers. In other words, what they found was that saroopenia in aging is dominated by the loss of the strongest, most powerful, largest ﬁbers. But they're just sort of ghosts, and they can be brought back to life by training. And the increase in muscle size of ﬁbers is dominated by the return and increase in size of these high-powered, Type II muscle fibers. But even if we set that aside, it is incontrovertible that resistance training for strength can increase muscle mass, bone density, power and function in older adults. This requires age-speciﬁc reformulation of programming and diet to overcome age-related anabolic resistance. to avoid overtraining, and to maintain progress. In particular, older adulls seem to be what Andy Baker and I--a colleague of mine and I recently coined this Ierm: "Vo|ume~Sensitive and Intensity-Dependent." Too much volume will crush an older lifter, but if you back off too much on the intensity, they will lose their GainZz. So we need to keep the weight rather high in older lifters, but we tend to decrease their volume to improve their recovery Modiﬁcations like this can help us get people slrongerfor a long time, even very old people. And so, like Jan Sundell in this paper published in the journal Preventative Medicine in 2011, I have been led to conclude that resistance training is an effective tool against the metabolic and frailty syndromes. By now, I hope you have a better idea ofjust how incredibly important is such a claim. My prescription for the aging adult is a training program for the Masters athlete. A long-term regimen for the optimization of health, function and body composition, Again, I do not have the lime tonight to lay out the argument for why barbells are the resistance training modality par excellence, That is another topic for another time. But for now I assert that they are safe, with a minimum of unexpected, impulsive forces and joint torques, They are exquisitely dosablez I can add as little as a half-pound to my client's bar, and I can start her off with a broomslick, if need be. A year later, I can have her deadlifting 100 |bs...150, 200 lbs. Barbell Iraining is comprehensive, maximizing the recruitment of muscle mass, loading the spine and hips, tapping into all three energy systems. and lraining full mobility and balance. As we have just seen at length, a resistance training program for strength addresses the Sick Aging Phenotype And this is most emphatically true of barbell training as well, because barbell training is the most powerful form of resistance training, permitting the most weight to be lifted through the largest range of motion. Four exercises programmed over two or three days a week is all it takes to get stronger And when we add a conditioning component, we're cooking with gas. We intensify all these benefits, but that doesn't have to mean long slow distance training, like jogging or running. It can mean intervals, sprints, kettlebells, you name it. In the Starting Strength community, we like The Prowler, a type of sled, for its its intensity, its simplicity, its versatility and its \ime effciency. It has no eccentric component, so it allows us to condition without soreness and wilhout major impediments to recovery. Here is Gus at the Wichita Falls Athletic Club, Mark Rippetoe's gym, I had the honor meeting this lady earlier this month. Not long ago, before she started her strength and conditioning program, she told me, she was weak as a kitten, unable to get around her own home without assistance or a walker. So there you have it: our exercise prescription for the aging adu|t-- our training program for the Masters athlete. It's what me, and Jordan and others have come to call Barbell Medicine, a special kind of exercise medicine that puts strenglh first. Because it is strength, or the lack of it, that dominates our physical aging phenotype. The pattern of our modern life is not dominated by the need to go out and run ten miles. It's rather more about pushing a wheelbarrow, or heaving a suticase overhead onto a shelf, lifting a heavy bag of groceries up off the floor, rising from a lawn chair to greet a friend, or power-cleaning a grand daughter onto our shoulders. With barbell medicine, we can make all of these movement patterns. which are the patterns of our lives, the patterns of our physical lives, we can make them stronger and more powerful, and optimize our potential Io realize a Healthy Aging Phenotype.
